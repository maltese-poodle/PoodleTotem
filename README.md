TOTEM is a 38 key column-staggered choc split keyboard. It is meant to be used with a SEEED XIAO BLE or RP2040.
It was created for the SEEED XIAO keyboard contest.\
[Here](https://www.hackster.io/geist/totem-a-tiny-splitkeyboard-with-splay-cb2e43) you can read about the process of making it.

### INSPIRATION

I've added the additional pinky key to make the TOTEM compatible with the layout boards like the [Balbuzard](https://github.com/brow/balbuzard) by [Tom Brow](https://github.com/brow) and the [Osprette](https://github.com/smores56/osprette) by [Sam Mohr](https://github.com/smores56) use, where you put the keybinding of the top left and right keys on an outer pinky key.
